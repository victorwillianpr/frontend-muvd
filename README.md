# Muvd 🍿 Fullstack Project - Frontend 🚀

Muvd is a fullstack project that combines web development and movies. As the creator of this project, I've crafted every step, from the backend to the frontend, to deliver a movie information viewing experience that simulates streaming websites.
The user interface for Muvd is built with React.js. With the assistance of TailwindCSS and Heroicons, we've created a clean design to make the cinematic exploration as responsive as possible.

## Getting Started
To run the Muvd frontend, you'll need to follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
2. **Start the Server**:
 Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
    ```bash
    npm start
This will initiate the Muvd frontend, and you're all set to interact with the fullstack project.

Explore the backend part of the project in the corresponding repository for a Muvd experience.
